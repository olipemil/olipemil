Hi! I am Emily Oliphant. I am a postdoc at MIT working at decoding the chemistry of quantum mechanics. Here is [my webpage](https://olipemil.github.io/). 
My main project is COGITO (Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals).
The [COGITO website](https://olipemil.github.io/cogito-website/) is live, but the main COGITO repo is still private until its main paper is published. If you are interested in early access, please email me!
